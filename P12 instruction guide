Installation.ps1

$mypwd = ConvertTo-SecureString "YOURPASSWORD"-AsPlainText -Force
Import-PfxCertificate -FilePath YOURCERTNAME.p12 -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\My -Password $mypwd

Uninstallation.ps1

Get-ChildItem Cert:\CurrentUser\My\YOURCERTIFICATETHUMBPRINT | Remove-Item

DetectionMethods.ps1

$Check = Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:\CurrentUser\My | Where-Object {$_.Thumbprint -eq "YOURCERTIFACTETHUMBPRINT"}
if ($check){
